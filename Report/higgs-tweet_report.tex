\begin{abstract}
In this project we analyze the influence dynamics within a certain interest-group during a viral event. The event in question is the 4. July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, made by researchers at CERN in Switzerland. We study a scraped dataset comprising of an underlying 450k-user Twitter follower network together with 13M lines of an action log, collected between the 1st and 8th of July 2012. We find that

\section{Introduction}

Possible goals:

Analyze the influence dynamics of a web-community during a viral event. Quite general. Quite a hard problem. 

Q: Which users to influence if we wish to spread scientific misinformation? 

Q: Do the power dynamics computed from the action log change over time? 

Q: Do the computed seed-nodes (using IM) differ significantly from time to time / do they differ much from simpler statistical centrality heuristics? 

Interesting statistics: 

- general activity through time of an average user (cluster?)



Limitations: 

- very incomplete dataset

- only pairwise interactions

\section{Related Work}

\section{Preliminaries}

Present IM problem

\section{The Data Set}

Social Network + Action Log

500k users; 14M edges (following/followee); 500k directed, typed actions

\section{Our Approach}

Combining social network $+$ "action edges" and running community based IM. 

\subsection{Computing Edge Probabilities}

\textbf{Idea:} Use WC probs with different weights for different action-types. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Hard to validate

\item Hard to compare

\item Effects of $p_{uv}$ on runtime. 

\item Effects of $p_{uv}$ on spread. 

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Influence Maximization}

Greedy, CELF, or MIA? What to do..

\textbf{Idea:} Divide and conquer--preprocess with community detection. Wang (2012)

\section{Results} 

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Future Work}

Impact of time. 

Content of tweets - sentiment analysis. 

Compute $p_{uv}$ using unsupervised learning approach. Perform evaluative analysis.
